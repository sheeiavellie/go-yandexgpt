## Contribution guideline

### Contributing
You can contribute by:
- Reporting issues
- Suggesting new features and enhancements
- Improving documentation

For **minor** changes you can just send a PR without opening linked issue.

For **major** changes open an issue.

### Commits and PRs
I highly encourage using [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/ "conventional commits") style in commit messages.

For PR titles it is *required* to use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/ "conventional commits") style titles.

You can use any of these prefixes:
- fix
- feat
- chore
- refactor
- test
- ci
